## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## User stories
  [√] User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text
      [√] Default
      [√] Outline
      [√] Text
  [√] User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
  [√] User story: I can choose to disable the button
  [√] User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
  [√] User story: I can have different button sizes
  [√] User story: I can have different colors
  [√] User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
  [√] User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough
  [√] User story: I can still access all button attributes
